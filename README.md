This is a React.js app built with Vite and styled with Tailwind CSS. The app is deployed on Netlify. This README provides instructions for installing and deploying the app.

## Installation

To run the app locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>

2. Navigate to the project directory:

The app will be available at http://127.0.0.1:5173/.

##Deployment on Netlify
To deploy the app on Netlify, I follow these steps:

1. Create a Netlify account if you don't already have one: Netlify Sign-Up

Log in to your Netlify account.

Click the "New site from Git" button on the Netlify dashboard.

Choose your Git provider (e.g., GitHub), and grant Netlify access to your repository.

Configure the build settings:

Build Command: yarn build (or npm run build)
Publish Directory: dist
Click the "Deploy Site" button to trigger the deployment.

Netlify will build and deploy your app. Once the deployment is complete, you'll receive a unique URL where your app is hosted.

Additional Configuration
You can customize the app and adjust the Tailwind CSS configuration as needed. Be sure to check the Vite and Tailwind CSS documentation for more information:
